# Benchmark run eval-cRl-2026-08-29T17:04:39

Judges: one habit-hooks metric per code smell (0 occurrences = pass;
suggested smells carry half the weight of enforced ones), plus the
valid_code, ships_tests, and correct gates. Higher score = cleaner.
Each smell column holds the occurrence count (enforced smells first,
then suggested). The first table keeps only the smells with at least
one hit across the run; the second carries the full catch list. File
and line locations live in the `habit-hooks/` reports next to this
file; the generated code sits in `src/`.
